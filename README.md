# Reverse-List
Solution for "Reverse Linked List"

The code demonstrates how to reverse a singly linked list in Python. It includes a "ListNode" class that represents individual nodes of the linked list. The "Solution" class has a "reverseList" method that takes the head of the linked list as an argument and reverses the order of the nodes in the list.

To use the code, create instances of the "ListNode" class for each node in the linked list and connect them using the "next" attribute. Then, create an instance of the "Solution" class and call the "reverseList" method, passing the head of the original linked list. The method will return the new head of the reversed list.

You can access the reversed linked list by following the "next" attribute of each node, starting from the returned head.

The code provides a simple and efficient solution for reversing a singly linked list and can be easily incorporated into larger projects.
